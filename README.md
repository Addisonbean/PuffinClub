## Running locally

You'll need to have [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed, which you can get from npm: `npm install -g typescript`

To compile the TypeScript files run `tsc` in the `frontend` directory. For development, `tsc --watch` is recommended, as that will automatically recompile the files when a change is made.

Then you can just open `frontend/index.html`.
