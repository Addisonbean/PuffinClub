## Running locally

You'll need to have [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed, which you can get from npm: `npm install -g typescript`

To compile the TypeScript files run `tsc --outDir frontend/dist --watch frontend/src/*.ts`. Remove the `--watch` option if you don't want TypeScript to recompile the files when changed.

Then you can just open `frontend/index.html`.
