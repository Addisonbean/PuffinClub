# TODO:

 - Make a Game class
 - Make a Collidable interface (maybe not that same name though)
   - Add a method like `collisionBox` that returns a `CollisionBox` object
 - Make `Sprite.draw` add things to a queue to be drawn with z-indices
 - Get good images/art (ask Landon)
 - Find a backend framework (I'm thinking something in Rust, maybe [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) or [Gotham](https://gotham.rs/)..?)
