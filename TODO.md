# TODO:

 - Make a Game class
 - Make `CollisionBox` a trait???
 - Make `Sprite.draw` add things to a queue to be drawn with z-indices
 - Use [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/)?
 - Get good images/art (ask Landon)
 - Find a backend framework (I'm thinking something in Rust, maybe [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) or [Gotham](https://gotham.rs/)..?)
